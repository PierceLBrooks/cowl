/**
 * Iterator API.
 *
 * A CowlIterator is a wrapper around a function that gets called for every element
 * matched by a query submitted to a CowlOntology. By providing a generic context pointer,
 * you can plug any data structure (loggers, collections, etc.) which allows
 * for arbitrarily complex queries.
 *
 * The iterator function returns a `boolean` that can be used to control iteration:
 * by returning `true` iteration goes on to the next element,
 * while returning `false` causes it to stop. This is useful if, for example,
 * you want to find the first element matching certain criteria.
